You have been living under a rock if you haven't seen this:

How are we doing today in Cybersecurity with our "Big Rocks?"
<!--more-->
According to every Cybersecurity awareness test I have ever taken, humans are the weakest link in security and the most effective method for defending against attacks is training and awareness. Or better stated, changing the culture to understand and care about security.

Covey goes on to explain your big rocks should get 80% of your attention. Is 80% of your Cyber security budget and effort aimed at changing your culture or is it paying for a bunch of technology?

Let's dive a bit deeper into what we are protecting. We are protecting data in a way that only the right resource at the right time gets access to the data. So what's the big rock to solve to here? Is it to protect the data at the endpoints or to build complex secure networks to house data into security boundaries? I recently asked some Cisco Security experts these questions during their presentation for their Zero Trust solution. They agreed the big rock was at layer 7 and that their whole plan never got past layer 4. Their reasoning for this was that data marking, tagging, and categorization was too hard to solve to.

The 2 big rocks for cyber security are:

 1. Fix your culture - Users should understand cyber security risks, should be actively ensuring policies, be held accountable, and in general care.
  
 2. Use modern methods to store and transmit your data. Mark, tag and categorize appropriately.

After those two we can talk about defense in depth.
